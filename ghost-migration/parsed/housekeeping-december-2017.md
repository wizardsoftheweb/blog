* [Sensible SSH with Ansible](https://blog.wizardsoftheweb.pro/tag/sensible-ssh-with-ansible/) was delayed by a flood of yak shaves, but it's still (mostly) in active development.
* I'll be shaking down [a new tool](https://github.com/wizardsoftheweb/wotw-highlighter/tree/dev) over the course of [Let's Encrypt from Start to Finish](https://blog.wizardsoftheweb.pro/tag/lets-encrypt-from-start-to-finish/); it's the most involved yak shave from Sensible SSH.
* [Let's Encrypt from Start to Finish](https://blog.wizardsoftheweb.pro/tag/lets-encrypt-from-start-to-finish/) will most likely be finished and published in its entirety by the end of this week (possibly next week; probably next week; I'm guessing next week). You can actually read [a full draft on GitHub](https://github.com/wizardsoftheweb/lets-encrypt-from-start-to-finish/blob/master/original-post.md). I'll be polishing that, adding more documentation, and hopefully building a couple of end-to-end demos as I move it over.
* I have a few update posts planned and some of them drafted, but nothing scheduled yet. I'd like to come back to these in the near future:
    * [KeePass + ssh](https://blog.wizardsoftheweb.pro/keepass-ssh/): I've spent a few months getting really mad at Microsoft and have a few snippets that have improved my original build. Unsurprisingly, the Linux build has worked beautifully from day one.
    * [Docker in WSL](https://blog.wizardsoftheweb.pro/docker-in-wsl/): Not a whole lot has changed in stable channels (as far as I know), but Microsoft's been publicizing some fairly major paradigm shifts that deserve exploration. I'm not waiting with bated breath. I am, however, excited to see what's change with [LinuxKit](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit); those devs are amazing.
    * I've got some very tentative plans to come back around to [NPM Lifecycle](https://blog.wizardsoftheweb.pro/npm-lifecycle-stages-a-study/) with some containerization tooling. I've since written [another tool brute-force documentation tool](https://wizardsoftheweb.github.io/pylint-shortcodes/) that needs attention, and they're both basically the same problem.
* My big, long-term goal for 2018 is to break out my writing system into a usable tool. It's more a collection of tools and some opinionated configuration than anything else, and I don't see it growing much beyond that. Right now it's built via copypasta and I hate that. Plus the yak shave potential is so high with that project that I can't not do it.
